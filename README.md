# Node Modules
I had to remove the node modules from the repo as electron is bigger than the max size of git. In order to install the depenancies, run the following commands in the root directory of the repo:

```bash
npm install electron angular
sudo npm install electron -g
```

This will install electron globally, as well as in the app.

# Updates
```diff
+ started work on electron app
+ made a test card for the UI
- removed the node_modules for upload reasons
+ added angular.js
+ added cool image of app so far to readme (hopefully it works)
+ added config.js to turn off and on dev mode
```
